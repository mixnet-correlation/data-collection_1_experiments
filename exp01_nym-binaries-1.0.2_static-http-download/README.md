# First Experiment (`baseline`)

This is our baseline experimental scenario: no changes to Nym's timing/delay values or cover generation functionality. We only modify the gateway to trace flows at the SphinxFlow level, reduce the epoch length to 3 minutes, and fix a buffer reordering bug on endpoints (patch by the Nym developers).
