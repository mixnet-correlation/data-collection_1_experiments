# Eighth Experiment (`live-nym`)

In this experiment, we essentially redo `baseline`, but on the live Nym network and using a much more recent Nym version (`nym-binaries-v1.1.13`). That is, we take Nym as unmodified as possible (except for the necessary patches to make our SphinxFlow tracking work), in particular, without changes to cover traffic or timing/delay behavior. We collect data not in an isolated, Docker-based setup, but by operating a private gateway on the live Nym network to which five endpoint pairs (indepedent Hetzner instances) connect to conduct their downloads via the deployed Nym network.

The only major Nym behavior change is that we disable the function call `self.adjust_current_average_message_sending_delay()` at `https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/2878e9be9d0c397a746a8c942b818ac1168dff6f/clients/client-core/src/client/real_messages_control/real_traffic_stream.rs#L336`. This way, we disable the recent self adjustment behavior of endpoints to increase or decrease their sending rate (`Î»`) based on backpressure from their gateway. We disable this behavior in order to take out this additional variable from influencing our results and to maintain some more consistency with our earlier experiments. The remaining modifications enable our endpoints to connect to and use our private gateway.
