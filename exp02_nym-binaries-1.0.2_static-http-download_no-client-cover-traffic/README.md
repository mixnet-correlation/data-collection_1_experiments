# Second Experiment (`no-cover`)

In addition to all the baseline modifications we apply to the Nym codebase with `baseline`, we also patch `nym-client` and `nym-socks5-client` to disable the generation of gap-filling and background cover traffic. We aim to show the impact that cover traffic has on anonymity with this experiment.
